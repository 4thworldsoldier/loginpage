# loginpage
this is the git repo for the FE 
It is built with vanilla js, css and html

test login credentials
    "email": "test@gmail.com",
    "password": "password1234"
Due to time constraints i was only able to build the login page and added some validation like non empty field and password length

the page is hosted on netlify
